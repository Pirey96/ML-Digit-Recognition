Experimetation with scikit learn

First step is to verify how the data is organized in this data set. 
There are 70 000 data points with 784 components for each one This is so becuase the 28 by 28 pixel image is stored as an array. IF we rehsape the image using the reshape method form matplolib we can visualize the data.

The data_aquisition method serves to get the data and organize it approproiately into test and training sets. 

Scikit learn makes this task very trivial.
